Responsibilities
We will split the features to implement evenly among us and we will try to understand the code to implement the new features respectively. If one of us has a proposed design on a feature they will share and discuss with the other through rough code concepts and prototype UML diagrams till both of us agree on the suggested design to finalise it.
